## FAQs 
**Q : Do I need prior ML or coding experience to participate?**

A : No. The platform handles data exploration, blend creation, and one-click fine-tuning for you. Basic familiarity with reading dataset labels and interpreting accuracy metrics is helpful, but mentors will be available to guide every step. Curiosity and a willingness to experiment matter more than deep technical skills.

**Q : Who can participate?**

A : Anyone in the DF org who has already registered (currently 32 people total). No external sign-ups or last-minute additions.

**Q : How are teams formed?**

A : You self-organize into teams of 3–4. We’ll finalize rosters in Slack the week before the event.

**Q : What data can we use?**

A : All text and image datasets listed in the Data Blending Platform, plus any synthetic slices you create there. No private datasets from outside the platform.

**Q : Can we have multimodal blend recpies?**

A : Not for this datathon. For this round we can only support staying in a single modality. You can choose either the Text track, the Image track, or the Red-Teaming track.

**Q : What’s the Red-Teaming track?**

A : A special track focused on discovering adversarial or harmful-content failure cases in existing models using blended text data.

**Q : How long until we see results?**

A : Leaderboard metrics usually appear 25–40 minutes after submission.

**Q : What compute resources are provided?**

A : The platform  will schedule GPUs for you, so you don’t need to worry about provision anything!

**Q : How many submissions can we make?**

A : Unlimited, but we'd like you to be intentional with every blend that you submit.

**Q : Do we keep IP rights to the blend or model?**

A : Everything stays internal to NVIDIA and follows normal corporate IP policy.

**Q : Who do we ping for help during the event?**

A : You can directly reach out to Ramani on slack or use the #data-blending-challenge Slack channel to ask for help. Mentors will be online and in person throughout both days.
