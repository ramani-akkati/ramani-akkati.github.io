## Judging Rubrics

### Pre-Existing Use Case

| KPI | Weight | Description |
|-----|-------:|-----------------------------------------|
| **Best Δ vs Baseline** | 40 |• Improvement % = (team score – baseline) ÷ baseline × 100. |
| **Blend Ingenuity** <br>(novel pairing, clever slice selection) | 40 | Judges rate originality & strategic value of the blend.<br>Sub-criteria:<br>a) Novel dataset pairing<br>b) Smart weighting/slice logic<br>c) Clear rationale for each choice. |
| **Presentation & Impact Story** | 10 | Panel of judges score live pitch on five sub-criteria:<br>a. Problem Fit & Use-Case<br>b. Clarity of Blend Logic<br>c. Demo Depth (live or recorded)<br>d. Feasibility / Next Steps<br>e. Visual & Narrative Quality |
| **Documentation & Reproducibility** | 10 | Judges verify recipe completeness & ability to reproduce results from provided logs/scripts. |


### New Use Case

| KPI | Weight | Description |
|-----|-------:|---------------------------------|
| **Use-Case Value & Impact** | 30 | Panel scores on:<br>a) Problem significance (who cares & why?)<br>b) Expected ROI / strategic fit for NVIDIA & DataFactory<br>c) Breadth of downstream adoption paths |
| **Blend Ingenuity** <br>(novel pairing, clever slice logic) | 30 | a) Novel dataset combinations<br>b) Smart weighting / slicing choices<br>c) Clear justification of each component |
| **Technical Feasibility & Validation Plan** | 20 | a) Soundness of the proposed modelling approach<br>b) Credible evaluation strategy (fair, not gameable)<br>c) Realistic resource/risk assessment |
| **Prototype Evidence & Demo Depth** <br>(Presentation & Impact Story) | 10 | Based on live presentation:<br>a) Functioning proof-of-concept or qualitative results<br>b) Clarity of walk-through & insights gleaned so far |
| **Documentation & Reproducibility** | 10 | Judges verify recipe completeness & ability to reproduce results from provided logs/scripts. |
