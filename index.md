# Data Blending Challenge 2025 
### *July 24th - 25th · NVIDIA DF Data Intelligence* 

---

## What *is* the Data Blending Challenge?

**Data Blending Challenge 2025** is a 2 day long, hands-on datathon where small teams remix NVIDIA’s existing datasets into **high-value, low-latency blends**, then prove their worth with quick-turn fine-tuning and live benchmarks.

### Why we’re doing it
- **Unlock hidden signal.** We already own terabytes of labeled data, so the next accuracy jump often comes from **smart combinations**, not more collection.
- **Level-up annotators.** You know the data best. This event turns that knowledge into model-ready assets and production pilots.
- **Ship fast.** Winning blends move straight into a follow-up.

### How it works
1. **Explore slices** in the Blend Builder UI and drag-drop them into a proposed dataset.
2. **One-click train** a model — results auto-land on the leaderboard.
3. **Iterate for uplift** until you beat a baseline or craft a compelling new application.
4. **Pitch & demo** — judges score ingenuity, impact, and reproducibility.

### What you’ll leave with
- A **blended dataset** + replayable training recipe.
- A **fine-tuned model** that either outperforms or opens a new frontier.
- A **clear impact story** ready for exec review.

Bring your dataset instincts, creative risk-taking, and caffeine of choice — we’ll supply the GPUs, mentors, and prizes.
