# What is the Data Blending Challenge?

The Data Blending Challenge is a two-day sprint where small teams of 3‚Äì4 people explore new ways to combine our existing datasets and see how the blends affect model performance.

DataFactory already holds dozens of labeled text and image datasets, each gathered for a single purpose. Your task is to mix and match slices to improve model task performance, or even innovate new model tasks. For example, merging product reviews with support-ticket logs might sharpen sentiment analysis, while combining retail product photos with street-scene images could improve object detection. Over the two days you‚Äôll create those blends, one-click fine-tune models on them, and get near instant feedback.

## Why we‚Äôre doing it
-  Stretch the value of data we already own‚Äîno new collection needed.
-  Learn how different data sources interact and influence model quality.
-  Surface quick wins that can move straight into follow-up projects.

## How it works
1. **Explore:** Log in to the Data Blending Platform, browse text / image datasets, and inspect slices with the built-in tools.
2. **Assemble:** Tag useful slices or generate synthetic ones, then upload your blend and pick a track (Text, Image, or Red-Teaming).
3. **Fine-tune:** Launch a one-click job; leaderboard scores appear in 25‚Äì40 min.
4. **Improve:** Tweak slices, re-submit, repeat.
5. **Demo (Friday PM):** Present your top blend, model stats, and key takeaways.

## What you‚Äôll leave with
- A blended dataset with a reproducible training script.
- A fine-tuned model that improves accuracy or unlocks a new application.
- A concise impact summary for leadership review.

Bring your data intuition and energy - GPUs, mentors, and snacks will be on site.
