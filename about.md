## Mission
Modern ML teams already sit on **petabytes of raw data**—yet the next accuracy jump rarely comes from collecting *more* data.  
Instead, we unlock value by **strategically combining the slices we already own**:

* **Balance the long-tail:** merge edge-case traffic scenes with common-case driving footage.  
* **Add new signal:** pair LiDAR frames with dash-cam video for richer supervision.  
* **Transfer schemas:** map coarse sentiment labels onto fine-grained emotion tags to accelerate labeling.  

Data-Blending Lab 2025 is where annotators become **blend architects**, turning dormant assets into production-ready gold.

## Event Goals
1. **Ship measurable uplift.** Produce blended datasets + fine-tuned models that beat an internal baseline *or* enable a brand-new, demonstrably valuable use-case.    
2. **Document and reproduce.** Leave behind replayable notebooks, configs, and concise run logs so the DI team can pilot winning blends the very next sprint.  
3. **Spark invention.** Reward creative pairings and clever slice weighting that push beyond “obvious” joins.

## Success Criteria Snapshot

| What we measure | How it scores |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Δ vs Baseline** | ≥ +15 % lift → Excellent tier |
| **Blend Ingenuity** | Judges rate novelty & strategic value |
| **Presentation & Impact Story** | 5-criteria live pitch score |
| **Documentation & Reproducibility** | Must rerun clean on infra |
